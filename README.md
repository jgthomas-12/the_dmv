# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

1. At first I just started trying things. I had the right idea in the wrong place and let it get away from me for a little bit. Similar to the IC. I need to start moving faster because ocne I get rolling, things start to fall into place. I searched and struggles to make the initialize method work, I googled and tried different things. Eventually I went on to the study hall and as I was talking through the issue I figured out the first error. I was looking in the wrong file. If I'm not sure what the error is saying, I need to find a better way of coming up with the solution. Next time I will reread, aloud, the error and make sure I'm seeing all the parts of the line. It was telling me the file name, I just wasn't paying close enough attention and trying to go fast. 

2. I had to figure out what was going on before I could figure out how to fix it. You have to get inside the scope of each class and method to understand what's calling on what, where and how each is interacting. That was a little disorienting at first and caused me a little extra time.

3. Once I got rolling, I knew what I was looking for and things started to pop out and roll along. The consistency and the ability to read the stack error messages helped to navigate and understand the errors.
